## Getting Started
I always forget how to get old projects running when I have't touched them in a while. I know this stuff is basic, but it saves me some Googling

* Navigate to the root of the project in the terminal
* Run `npm install`

### Running the app locally
* Navigate to the root of the project in the terminal
* Run `npm run dev`

### Updating Github Pages
* Navigate to the root of the project in the terminal
* Run `npm run deploy`
